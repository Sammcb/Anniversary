# Anniversary

This is a small game I made using the [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org) engine for my girlfriend to celebrate our anniversary. I made all the graphics in [Aesprite](https://www.aseprite.org) and music using [BeepBox](https://www.beepbox.co). I have included the `.aes` files and BeepBox links so you can change the assets if you would like.

## Installation

### macOS

To run the game on macOS, first, download `love.app` and install it in `/Applications` directory. Then you can either type `make run` to build the `.love` application, `make launch` to launch the game without building, or `make debug` to launch the game with console output.
